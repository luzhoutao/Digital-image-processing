## Spatial Filtering   

Write a program to perform spatial filtering of an image (see Section 3.4 regarding implementation).  You can fix the size of the spatial mask at 3 x 3, but the coefficients need to be variables that can be input into your program.  This project is generic, in the sense that it will be used in other projects to follow.

## Enhancement Using the Laplacian    

(a) Use the programs developed in Project 03-03 to implement the Laplacian enhancement technique described in connection with Eq. (3.6-7).

(b) Duplicate the results in Fig. 3.38.  You can download the original image from the book web site.

## Unsharp Masking   

(a) Use the program developed in Project 03-03 to implement high-boost filtering, as given in Eq. (3.6-9).  The averaging part of the process should be done using the mask in Fig. 3.32(a).

(b) Download Fig. 3.40(a) from the book web site and enhance it using the program you developed in (a).  Your objective is to approximate the result in Fig. 3.40(e).
