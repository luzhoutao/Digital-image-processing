Two algorithms for resizing the image:##w
  1. Duplication of nearest pixel: to assign every pixel in the new location by replicating the value of its nearest neighbor
  2. Bilinear approximation: to estimate the pixelsâ€™ value in consideration of its four nearest neighbors
  
Measure the performance by recovery rate.
