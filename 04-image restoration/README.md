## Periodic Noise Reduction Using a Notch Filter    

(a) Implement sinusoidal noise.  The inputs to the program are the amplitude, A, and the two frequency components u0 and v0 on two spatial dimension.

(b) Add sinusoidal noise to the test image, with u0 = M/2 (the image is square) and v0 = 0.  The value of A is high enough for the noise to be clearly visible in the image.

(c) Display the spectrum of the image. Resize the image before adding noise to it.

(d) Notch-filter the image using a notch filter .

## Parametric Wiener Filter    

(a) Implement the Wiener Filter.

(b) Implement a blurring filter 
    >here, use motion blur according to the physical model of it.

(c) Restore the image using the parametric Wiener filter given in Eq. (5.8-3).
